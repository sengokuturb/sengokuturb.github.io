	<h1>WHAT'S A TURB???</h1>
	Sengoku TURB is a (currently) untranslated action JRPG on the Dreamcast, developed by QNEP and published by NEC Home Electronics. It never left Japan and I don't speak Japanese,
	so I can't say for sure	how much impact it had at the time, <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%88%A6%E5%9B%BDTURB">but seems to at least be big enough to have it's own JP 
	Wikipedia page.</a> Regardless, the game intrigues a lot of people in the English speaking world (me and like 3 other people). Let's run through some history.
	<br>
	<h2>Bio_100%</h2>
	Bio_100% was (is?) a doujin game circle that developed shareware games for the PC-98. Among their numerous releases, a few games concern Sengoku TURB in particlar. 
	<br>
	<br>
	"TURB" is a series of bite sized RPGs that released in 3 episodes. You can play as a little cat, and I honestly can't find out much more than that. It's to find any videos or screenshots of these games. But I did
	find an archive(?) of these games on <a href="https://www.vector.co.jp/soft/dos/game/se003374.html">this</a> <a href="https://www.vector.co.jp/soft/dos/game/se003376.html">website</a> 
	<a href="https://www.vector.co.jp/soft/dos/game/se003397.html">here.</a> <b>I can't 100% verify whether this site is safe or not, so download at your own risk.</b> If it means anything, 
	I can't even get the games to boot. I have 0 knowledge of DOS and PC-98 emulation.

	After presumable success, a spinoff of the TURB games was released. This spinoff was called "Sengoku TURB", a name it shares with the Dreamcast game.
	On this site, this version of the game will always be refered to as "Sengoku TURB PC-98" to avoid confusion. This game is a lot easier to find info and videos of.

	Here's a video of a guy playing Sengoku TURB PC-98 on Nico Nico Douga:

	<br>
	<br>
	As with the TURB games, I found this game archived on the same <a href="https://www.vector.co.jp/soft/dos/game/se000079.html">sketchy site.</a> I had no luck getting this one to boot either.

	<h2>The Dreamcast TURB</h2>
	<div style="display: flex;">
	<img src="images/boxart.png" alt="boxart for the dreamcast game" float="left" width="320" height="320">
	On January 14th, 1999, Sengoku TURB was released for the Dreamcast, only in Japan. This little action RPG appeals to a very specific low poly aesthetic that I (and many others) find really 
	charming.

	<br>
	<br>
	<div style="display: flex;">
	In Sengoku TURB, you play as Jino-chan, a human who crashlands on Raiyon (the setting of the game). She discovers that Raiyon is currently in a warring states-esque scenario, and decides to join up with the Cat Army.

	Along the way, Jino-chan runs into a cast of colorful characters who help her on her quest. Fun fact, the character designs were (at least partially) done by the same woman that did many of the early tamagotchi!
