    <h1>WHAT'S A TURB???</h1>
	<p>Sengoku TURB is a (currently) untranslated action JRPG on the Dreamcast, developed by QNEP and published by NEC Home Electronics. It never left Japan and I don't speak Japanese,
	so I can't say for sure	how much impact it had at the time. <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%88%A6%E5%9B%BDTURB">It seems to at least be big enough to have it's own JP 
	Wikipedia page.</a> Regardless, the game intrigues a lot of people in the English speaking world. Let's run through some history.
	<br>
	<h2>Bio_100%</h2>
	Bio_100% was (is?) a doujin game circle that developed a lot of free games for the PC-98. Among their numerous releases, a few games concern Sengoku TURB in particlar. 
	<br>
	<br>
	"TURB" is a series of bite sized RPGs that released in 3 episodes. You can play as a little cat, and I honestly can't find out much more than that. It's to find any videos or screenshots of these games. But I did
	find an archive(?) of these games on <a href="https://www.vector.co.jp/soft/dos/game/se003374.html">this</a> <a href="https://www.vector.co.jp/soft/dos/game/se003376.html">website</a> 
	<a href="https://www.vector.co.jp/soft/dos/game/se003397.html">here.</a> <b>I can't 100% verify whether this site is safe or not, so download at your own risk.</b> If it means anything, 
	I can't even get the games to boot. I have 0 knowledge of DOS and PC-98 emulation.
	<br>
	<br>
	After presumable success, a spinoff of the TURB games was released. This spinoff was called "Sengoku TURB", a name it shares with the Dreamcast game this site is primarily about.
	On this site, this version of the game will always be refered to as "Sengoku TURB PC-98" to avoid confusion. This game is a lot easier to find info and videos of. Here's a video of a guy 
	playing it on Nico Nico Douga:

	<br>
	<br>
	As with the TURB games, I found this game archived on the same <a href="https://www.vector.co.jp/soft/dos/game/se000079.html">sketchy site.</a> I had no luck getting this one to boot either.
