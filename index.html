	<h1>Welcome to the number 1 most UNoffical fan site for 戦国TURB (Sengoku TURB)!</h1>
	I made this site to compile information about Sengoku TURB, an action RPG developed by qnep for the Dreamcast. On this site you can expect to find a rundown of <a href="whats_turb.html">what TURB is,</a> some 
	<a href="guides.html">guides</a> to help my fellow english speaking fans, and <a href="misc.html">other cool stuff</a> that has to do with TURB. 
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>I'm just a fan.</b> I'm not qnep, nanorayspex, NEC Home Electronics, or Bio_100%, I just happened to snag this domain.
	<br>
	<br>
	If you have info you would like to share, comments, or questions about the site, <a href="mailto: sh1ttykickflips@gmail.com">email me!</a> Hope you can learn something new about TURB on this site!
	<h2>Latest News:</h2>
	2/22/24 - site up and running! information will be expanded on as we move forward, but we have the basic framework of this site down.
