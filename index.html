    <h1>2/21/24 - site VERY under contruction right now! i hope to have most of the website set up within the week!</h1>
	<p>Welcome to the number 1 most unoffical fan site for the little known jrpg 戦国TURB (Sengoku TURB). On this site you can expect to find a rundown of what TURB is, some guides to
	help my fellow english speaking fans, and other cool stuff I found out about this game. <b>I'm just a fan.</b> I'm not QNEP, NEC Home Electronics, or Bio_100%, I just happened to snag this domain.
	<br>
	If you have info you would like to share, comments, or questions about the site, <a href="mailto: sh1ttykickflips@gmail.com">email me!</a> Hope you can learn something new about TURB on this site!
